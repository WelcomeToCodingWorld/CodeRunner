First: Check certificate file location which will be in default_cert_file key, you will found it in openssl_get_cert_locations() its php openssl function:

php -r "print_r(openssl_get_cert_locations());"

Second: Download http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem


Third: Copy certificate PEM file into default_cert_file location:

sudo mv cacert.pem /opt/lampp/share/openssl/cert.pem


Note：
1.The ability of APNs to deliver remote notifications to a nonrunning app requires the app to have been launched at least once.
2.On an iOS device, if a user force-quits your app using the app multitasking UI, the app does not receive remote notifications until the user relaunches it.
