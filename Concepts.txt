The Client initiate the communication sessions with servers which await incoming request;

A Web Server provides only the Http content(web page);
A Application Server uses various protocols;

A shared resource  may be any of the server computer's software and electronic components from programs and data to processors and storage devices;

The sharing of resources of a server constitutes  a service;

Servers are classified by the services they provide.For example, a web server serves web pages and a file server serves computer files;

When a bank customer accesses online banking services with a web browser (the client), the client initiates a request to the bank's web server. The customer's login credentials may be stored in a database, and the web server accesses the database server as a client. An application server interprets the returned data by applying the bank's business logic, and provides the output to the web server. Finally, the web server returns the result to the client web browser for display.
