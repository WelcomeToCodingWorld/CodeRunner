Link is a file with your maven files. You want to download them but there may be some unexpected complications. It's possible that someone wearing black hat will replace files on this server with potentially virus infected version or generally considered as malicious. Team responsible for maven care about safety and want make you absolute certain about security of their system. That is why they publish checksum and signature for every version of maven.
If you have downloaded maven and you want to check if it's really what developers intended to share with you, you will want to compare checksum generated from the file you have downloaded and the checksum provided on the site. To do that in linux you will enter `md5sum <file>` to check what the <file> md5 sum is. It's implicite in this case that checksum provided by maven team is md5 and you can read it from checksum file extension(.md5). The same refers to Signature but in this case process is a little automatic. Just download both files available in Link section and Signature section to the same folder and run `gpg --verify <file with .asc at end>`

Signature is very similiar to md5 checksum but it makes a use of RSA or DSA algorithm rather than MD5. It's important from security point of view that md5 is obsolete and shouldn't be used when it comes to extreme conditions. Lots of people use sha256 or even better sha512 nowadays and if you see such checksum you can suppose these guys know what they are doin'.
