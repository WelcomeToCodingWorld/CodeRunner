1. storedProperty:let or var
2. computedProperty: var (because they are not fixed)
3. observer: storedProperty or inherited property(computed or stored)
4. getter and optional setter: computed property
5. lazy stored property : var -> because its initial value might not be retrieved until after instance initialization completes. Constant properties must always have a value before initialization completes, and therefore cannot be declared as lazy.
6. storedProperty : class  struct
7. computedProperty :class struct enumeration
8. always give stored type property a default value -> because the type itself does not have an initializer that can assign a value to a stored type property at initialization time
9. stored type property are initialized on their first access , does not need to be marked with the lazy modifier
10. class : computed type property for class type
